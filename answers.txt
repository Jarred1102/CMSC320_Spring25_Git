Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: 

Data Science could be applied to Machine Learning because it allows us to 
prepare, clean, analyze, and interpret large datasets, which are then used to train 
and optimize machine learning models, allowing them to make accurate predictions and 
extract valuable insights from data that would be difficult to identify manually.
